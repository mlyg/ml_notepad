# C++ programming in easy steps

## Chapter 1
1. C++ is **object-oriented** in nature compared to C which is procedural
2. **Preprocessor directive**: makes functions within standard C++ libraries available to a program e.g. '#include iostream' and 'using namespace std'; 
3. /* and */ should only be used to comment-out sections of code
4. Traditionally, returning a zero means that the program output successively
5. **float** is correct to **6** decimal places, **double** is correct to **10** decimal places
6. For **boolean** variables, always start the name with **'is'**
7. Use **lower camel case** for variables with multiple words
8. An array can store a string if the final character is **'\0'**
9. **Vectors** are like regular arrays but their size can be changed. The vector library needs to be included at the top. Vectors are declared as 'vector data-type vector-name (size, initial-value);
10. Constant names appear in upper case, and all const declarations must be initialised
11. enum provides a handy way to create a sequence of constant integers
