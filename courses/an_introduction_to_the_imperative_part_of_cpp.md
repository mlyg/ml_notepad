# An Introduction to the Imperative Part of C++

## Lecture 1
1. ** Declarative programming**: what to do, not how to do it - higher level of abstraction
2. **Imperative programming**: how to do it, not what to do - lower level of abstraction
3. **Functional programming**: subset of declarative programming, that uses subroutines that return a value, and cause minimal side effects
4. **Procedural programming**: subset of imperative programming, that uses subroutines that do not return values, causing side effects
5. C++ was developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in the early 1980's
6. A **compiler** converts the source code into machine instructions
7. A **linking program** links the compiled program components with each other and with a selection of routines from existing libraries of computer code

## Lecture 2
1. **Words in a programme belong to three types:**
* **Reserved words**: These are words such as if, int and else, which have a predefined meaning that cannot be changed
* **Library identifiers**: These words are supplied default meanings by the programming environment such as cin, cout and sqrt
* **Programmer-supplied identifiers**: variable names created by the programmer
2. C++ requires that all variables used in a program be given a data type
3. **Prefixes to control base of number:**
* "0": **octal**
* "0x": **hexadecimal**
* "0b": **binary**
4. The data type "char" is a subset of the data type "int"
5. Constants of type "int" may also be declared with an **enumeration** statement
6. The operator "&&" has a higher precedence than the operator "||"
